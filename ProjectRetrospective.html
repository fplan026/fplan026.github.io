  <h1>Project Retrospective</h1>
  <h2>-Work Flow-</h2>
    <p><b>What was the process or branching model each person used to pull, develop and push?</b><br>
      Each of us created our own development branch to make sure that we made changes separately. We pulled from the master branch to update our branch regularly. When we wanted to combine changes, we pushed to our branch, then merged to master 
      </p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>What development tools/frameworks did your project use?</strong><br>
      We used Grails as the framework for the backend. This offered support and organization for the groovy and java classes. For our front end we used REACT and react-router along with Javascript, HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>How effectively did your team manage task distribution among team members?</strong><br>
      We managed task distribution by breaking down each stage into specific task. Everyone on the team was assigned to user stories and we ensured that the work was distributed evenly. We kept each other updated on our progress and communicated through Slack. Every week, we met once to twice to discuss our progress. At each meeting, detailed minutes were taken to ensure progress. </p>

    <h2>-Project Retrospective-</h2>
    <p><b>What did your group do well?</b><br>
    The group did several things well. We had an open line of communication at all times through Slack. If someone had an idea, a concern or simply needed clarification they cold reach another member and have a response almost instantly. The group as a whole was very professional and courteous of one another. If disagreements came up they were usually met with a middle ground. Meetings were held once a week (or more if needed) with meeting minutes and topics of discussion recorded for future reference. Members worked together to overcome any confusions that came up over the use of Grails and React as these were new experiences for many in the group.</p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>What could your group have done better?</strong><br>
    Time management could have been improved as some tasks were left till the day before submission, however this is understandable as many members have work in other courses as well.</p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>What did you like about the tools and frameworks you used?</strong><br>
      Grails was a great framework to build our backend end from, as it supplied a database that allowed us to store user information. This in turn allowed the users credentials and preferences to be accessed at a later time even after the web application was terminated.<br>
    REACT was very helpful for the front end as it allowed us to create a single page web application. We were able to change the view based on user input as well as keep a user history, so in case the user uses the browser’s back buttons the program would not crash, but redirect them to the previous view. REACT also allowed us to integrate jvector map, which is a vector map that scales when zoomed in and out of, for the DISCOVER feature of our application.</p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>What didn’t you like about the tools and frameworks you used?</strong><br>
    While IntelliJ is a great IDE for editing and running our application we were initially excited because of its github integration. While we did like the ability to manually merge two separate files when conflicts existed, we did encounter several occasions where files would overwrite each other without notice. We are sure this is due to the learning curve and we think it would be a great asset once the team has sufficient experience with IntelliJ and git. </p>
